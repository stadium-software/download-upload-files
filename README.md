> ### File System Connector for Upload and Download of Files

In this sample, we make use of the File System Connector. We illustrate how to upload, download and delete a sample file from your file system. Additionally, we make use of the “File Exist” function to see if the sample file is in your file system.

#### Sample Highlights:

- Connecting to a File System
- Uploading a file
- Downloading a file
- Deleting a file
- Checking if a file exists
